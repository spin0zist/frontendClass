this is the first class note by Mosi.

first lets learn some terminal commands.

cd >>>  change directory
ls >>>  list the files in the current direcrory
mkdir filename  >>>> make a file in the current directory

You add the rest of them ( those you use every day )  gradually

next learn some Git command, for Gitlab and Github are the same.


to get repo for the first time use 
git clone repoAddress

to get the latest update 
git pull ( in the directory of the repo in your localhost )


to update github/gitlab repo from localhost:
( in the directory of the repo in localhost )

git add .     ( means that add all the files to the current git branch )
git commit -m "commit description"
git push origin master  



other git commands:

git status
git reflog
git branch
